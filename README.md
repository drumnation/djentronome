## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development
pnpm dev

# Build all packages
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint code
pnpm lint
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

This project uses Vitest for unit and integration testing.

## ðŸ“š Storybook

UI components can be developed and tested using Storybook:

```bash
# Start Storybook
cd apps/game-ui
pnpm storybook
```

## ðŸ§  Multi-Agent Development

This project is configured for development using specialized AI agents (Tony Stark, Spock, Q), each with their own set of rules and skill-jacks stored in the `.brain/` directory.

To switch the active agent context for AI tools (like Cursor), use the `change-agent` script:

```bash
# Switch to Agent Tony Stark (Frontend)
pnpm change-agent 1-agent-tony-stark

# Switch to Agent Spock (Core Systems)
pnpm change-agent 2-agent-spock

# Switch to Agent Q (Audio/Transcription)
pnpm change-agent 3-agent-q
```

This command updates the `.brain/config.json` and merges the selected agent's specific rules from `.brain/[agent-id]/.cursorrules` into the root `.cursorrules` file, making their context active.
