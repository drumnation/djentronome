# ECS Package Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the `@djentronome/ecs` package.

## Overview

The Entity Component System (ECS) package provides a foundational architecture for the Djentronome game engine. It enables efficient organization and processing of game objects through a decoupled, data-oriented design.

## Documentation Index

- [ECS Architecture Overview](./ecs-architecture.md): Core architectural principles and design decisions
- [Component System Documentation](./components.md): How to create and use components
- [System Documentation](./systems.md): Creating and managing game logic systems
- [Performance Optimizations](./performance.md): Tips for optimizing ECS performance

## API Reference

See the [README.md](../README.md) for a complete API reference.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { WorldImpl, Component, System } from '@djentronome/ecs';

// Create a world
const world = WorldImpl.create();

// Create an entity
const entity = world.createEntity('player');

// Add components, systems, etc.
```

## Integration with Other Packages

The ECS package integrates with:

- `@djentronome/game-loop`: For running the main game loop
- `@djentronome/physics`: For physics components and systems
- `@djentronome/rendering`: For rendering components and systems

## Contributing

If you're contributing to the ECS package, please follow these guidelines:

1. Keep components small and focused on a single aspect
2. Write tests for all new components and systems
3. Document public APIs thoroughly
4. Follow performance best practices
