This document provides an overview of the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture used in the Djentronome game engine.

## Architectural Principles

The ECS architecture is built on three core principles:

1. **Composition over Inheritance**: Game objects (entities) are composed of components rather than inheriting from base classes
2. **Data-Oriented Design**: Components are pure data without behavior
3. **Separation of Logic and Data**: Systems provide behavior that operates on components

## Design Decisions

### Entity Implementation

Entities are implemented as simple identifiers (numbers) with optional names. This approach provides:

- Memory efficiency (entities are just IDs)
- Simplicity (no complex entity hierarchy)
- Performance (fast lookups by ID)

### Component Design

Components are implemented as classes that implement the `Component` interface:

```typescript
interface Component {
  type: string;
  entityId: number;
}
```

Key features:
- Components are registered in a global registry
- Components contain only data, no behavior
- Each component belongs to a specific entity (via `entityId`)

### System Processing

Systems define behavior through their `update` method:

```typescript
interface System {
  id: string;
  priority: number;
  requiredComponents: string[];
  init?: (world: World) => void;
  update: (dt: number, entities: Entity[]) => void;
  cleanup?: () => void;
}
```

Systems are:
- Executed in priority order (lower number = higher priority)
- Only receive entities that have all required components
- Optionally initialized and cleaned up

### World Management

The `World` class is the central manager that:
- Creates and destroys entities
- Manages component attachment
- Keeps track of all systems
- Updates all systems in the correct order

## Performance Considerations

The ECS design prioritizes performance by:

1. **Batch Processing**: Systems process entities in batches
2. **Component Filtering**: Only relevant entities are processed by each system
3. **Memory Locality**: Components of the same type are stored together
4. **Minimal Allocation**: Reuse of existing objects where possible

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Component Granularity**: Components should be small and focused
2. **System Responsibility**: Each system should handle one aspect of game logic
3. **Entity Composition**: Build entities by combining simple components
4. **Query Optimization**: Use `getEntitiesWith()` efficiently to filter entities

## Future Improvements

Potential future enhancements include:

1. Component archetype support for faster entity queries
2. Event system for communication between systems
3. Serialization support for saving/loading
4. Worker-thread support for parallel system processing
