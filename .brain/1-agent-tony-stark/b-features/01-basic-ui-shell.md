- Technical Details Doc: ../../../../docs/features/basic-ui-shell/technical-details.md

## 1. Overview

This task involves developing the core UI shell for the Djentronome application. The UI shell will provide the basic layout and navigation structure for the game, including components like the header, footer, main content area, and navigation menu. This will serve as the foundation for all other UI elements and screens to be built upon.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Key Files & Modules

* `apps/game-ui/src/`: Main source directory for the frontend UI
* `packages/ui/src/`: Shared UI components package
* `packages/assets/`: Contains assets like sprites and sounds
* `packages/game-core/src/`: Core game logic and functionality

### 2.2. Dependencies

* React: Frontend UI library
* Mantine UI: UI component library (per the custom instructions)
* TypeScript: Static typing for JavaScript
* pnpm: Package manager used in the project
* Turborepo: Monorepo management tool

### 2.3. Potential Concerns

* Ensuring responsive design for different screen sizes and orientations
* Maintaining clear separation between UI shell and game-specific components
* Proper state management setup for future features
* [x] Mark as addressed

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Selected Paradigm

* Component-Based Architecture - Using React's component model to create modular, reusable UI elements
* [x] Confirmed with the user

### 3.2. Selected Design Patterns

* Container/Presenter Pattern - Separating UI rendering from business logic
* [x] Confirmed with the user
* Atomic Design - Building UI from atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages
* [x] Confirmed with the user

### 3.3. Architectural Considerations & Rationale

* The Component-Based Architecture using React allows for modular, reusable UI components that can be easily maintained and tested. This fits well with the game UI needs where various screens and components will be needed.
* The Container/Presenter pattern helps separate concerns between UI rendering and business logic, improving testability and maintainability.
* Atomic Design methodology provides a clear structure for building and organizing UI components, starting from simple elements (atoms) and combining them into more complex structures (molecules, organisms), which then form templates and pages.
* These approaches align with modern frontend development practices and the Mantine UI library mentioned in the custom instructions.
* [x] Confirmed with the user

## 4. Project Task List Foresight

### 4.1. Downstream Impacts

* This UI shell will serve as the foundation for all future UI features, including:
  * F7: Gameplay Visualization
  * F11: Gameplay UI Screens
  * F12: Latency Calibration Tool (UI Aspects)
  * F15: Visualization Enhancement (R3F)
* Decisions made in this task will impact the structure and approach for these future features
* [x] Reviewed and confirmed no negative impacts

### 4.2. Future-Proofing Considerations

* Implement a flexible layout system that can accommodate different screen types and components
* Set up proper state management architecture that will scale with additional features
* Create a robust component structure following Mantine UI best practices
* Establish clear patterns for navigation between different screens
* [x] Discussed with the user and incorporated feedback

    * Relevant Skill Jacks: (To be determined based on available skill jacks)

### 5.2. Selected Testing Approach

* For this UI Shell feature, we will primarily use:
  * Unit tests for individual components and utilities
  * Storybook stories for UI component visualization and documentation
  * Storybook interaction tests for testing component behavior
  * Visual regression tests to ensure UI consistency
* This approach ensures comprehensive testing of both appearance and functionality while keeping tests maintainable
* Integration and E2E tests will be minimal for this feature since it focuses primarily on UI structure
* [x] Confirmed testing approach aligns with project standards
