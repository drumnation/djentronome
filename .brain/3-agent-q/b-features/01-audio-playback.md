## 1. Overview

This task involves implementing functionality for loading and playing back audio files from the local file system in the Djentronome application. The implementation will include capabilities for loading various audio formats, controlling playback, synchronizing playback with game events, and managing audio resources efficiently.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Key Files & Modules

* `packages/core-audio/src/index.ts`: Contains the core `AudioEngine` class with basic audio loading and playback functionality
* `packages/core-audio/src/audio-engine.unit.test.ts`: Unit tests for the AudioEngine
* `packages/core-audio/src/types/index.ts`: Type definitions and exports for the audio module
* `packages/core-audio/package.json`: Package configuration with dependencies and scripts

### 2.2. Dependencies

* `@kit/testing`: Workspace package for testing utilities (unit, integration, e2e, etc.)
* `vitest`: Testing framework for unit and integration tests (version ^0.34.0)
* Web Audio API: Browser API for audio processing and playback

### 2.3. Potential Concerns

* Browser compatibility with different audio formats (MP3, WAV, OGG)
* Performance issues with large audio files
* Synchronization precision between audio events and gameplay
* Memory management for loaded audio resources
* [x] Mark as addressed

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Selected Paradigm

* Module-based architecture - Encapsulating audio functionality in a dedicated module with clear interfaces
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

### 3.2. Selected Design Patterns

* Factory Pattern - For creating and managing audio instances
* [ ] Confirmed with the user
* Observer Pattern - For handling audio events and synchronization with game state
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

### 3.3. Architectural Considerations & Rationale

* The audio system will be built around the Web Audio API, which provides low-latency audio processing capabilities essential for rhythm games.
* The existing AudioEngine class provides a solid foundation but needs to be extended to support local file loading and better synchronization.
* A dedicated file loader component will handle different loading strategies (File API, URL creation, etc.) to support various sources of local files.
* Audio synchronization will use a combination of precise timing mechanisms and event-based triggers to ensure accuracy.
* The architecture will maintain separation between audio loading, playback control, and synchronization to allow for easy extension and testing.
* Resource management will be a key consideration to prevent memory leaks and ensure optimal performance.
* [x] Confirmed with the user

## 4. Project Task List Foresight

### 4.1. Downstream Impacts

* This feature will provide the foundation for feature F10 (Initial Transcription Module) which will need to analyze audio from local files
* Will enable rhythm gameplay features that require synchronized audio
* May influence the approach for F14 (Streaming Service Integration) as similar audio management patterns could be applied
* [ ] Reviewed and confirmed no negative impacts

### 4.2. Future-Proofing Considerations

* Design the file loading mechanism to be extensible for different sources (local files, URLs, streams)
* Implement a clear event system that can be used for both immediate playback and future transcription needs
* Add hooks for custom processing that may be needed by future features
* Ensure the architecture can scale to handle multiple simultaneous audio sources
* [ ] Discussed with the user and incorporated feedback

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1. Available Testing Options

    * Command to run a single test: `pnpm --filter @djentronome/core-audio test:e2e -- -t "test name"`

### 5.2. Selected Testing Approach

* The primary testing approach will use unit tests to verify individual components (file loading, audio playback, synchronization).
* Integration tests will verify the interaction between components and with the Web Audio API.
* End-to-end tests will be used to validate the complete user flow for loading and playing local audio files.
* Test fixtures will include sample audio files in different formats to ensure compatibility.
* Mock implementations will be used for Web Audio API components that are challenging to test directly.
* [ ] Confirmed testing approach aligns with project standards.
