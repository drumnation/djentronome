## 1. Overview

This task involves setting up the core packages required for the Djentronome rhythm game project. These packages will provide the foundational structure and functionality needed for other features, including Web MIDI integration, pattern loading, game loops, hit detection, and scoring. The goal is to create properly structured packages with clear responsibilities, following the monorepo architecture with pnpm workspaces and Turborepo.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Key Files & Modules

* `package.json`: Root package definition for the monorepo
* `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: Workspace configuration for the monorepo
* `turbo.json`: Turborepo configuration for task orchestration
* `packages/README.md`: Documentation for the packages directory
* `packages/*/`: Existing package directories
* `.brain/2-agent-spock/d-skill-jacks/monorepo-tooling-pnpm-turbo.skill-jack.ts`: Skill jack for monorepo tooling

### 2.2. Dependencies

* `pnpm`: Package manager for the monorepo
* `turborepo`: Task runner and build system
* `typescript`: Programming language
* `vitest`: Testing framework for unit and integration tests
* `@kit/testing`: Shared testing utilities
* `@kit/tsconfig`: Shared TypeScript configuration
* `@kit/eslint-config`: Shared ESLint configuration
* `@kit/prettier-config`: Shared Prettier configuration

### 2.3. Potential Concerns

* Ensuring the right dependencies between packages to avoid circular dependencies
* [ ] Mark as addressed
* Making sure package exports are correctly defined for TypeScript imports
* [ ] Mark as addressed
* Establishing consistent patterns across packages for testing and documentation
* [ ] Mark as addressed

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Selected Paradigm

* Monorepo Architecture with Micropackages - Each package has a focused responsibility with clear boundaries
* [x] Confirmed with the user

### 3.2. Selected Design Patterns

* Module Pattern - Each package exports a clear API through its index.ts file
* [x] Confirmed with the user
* Dependency Injection - Systems will accept dependencies through constructor/parameters rather than importing directly
* [x] Confirmed with the user
* Entity-Component-System (ECS) - For game object management in core packages
* [x] Confirmed with the user

### 3.3. Architectural Considerations & Rationale

* The monorepo approach with micro-packages allows for better separation of concerns while enabling code sharing across the project. Each package will have a specific focus (e.g., audio handling, input processing, game state) which improves maintainability and testing.
* Using the module pattern with explicit exports ensures a clean public API for each package, hiding implementation details.
* Dependency injection improves testability by allowing mock dependencies in tests.
* The ECS pattern is well-suited for game development as it separates entities (game objects) from their data (components) and behavior (systems).
* [x] Confirmed with the user

## 4. Project Task List Foresight

### 4.1. Downstream Impacts

* The core packages will be used by almost all future features, so their design and API will impact the entire project.
* The decision on how to structure audio, input, and game state packages will affect the implementation of MIDI integration (F4).
* The game loop and pattern loading implementation will directly impact hit detection and scoring (F8).
* [x] Reviewed and confirmed no negative impacts

### 4.2. Future-Proofing Considerations

* Design packages with extension points for future features
* Create clear, documented APIs that won't need to change frequently
* Keep packages focused to minimize the impact of future changes
* Design with testability in mind to ensure future modifications don't break existing functionality
* [x] Discussed with the user and incorporated feedback

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1. Available Testing Options

* `[x] Unit Tests`
    * Location: `packages/[package-name]/src/test/`
    * Command to run all tests: `turbo run test`
    * Command to run a single test: `pnpm --filter @kit/[package-name] test:unit -- -t "test name"`
    * Relevant Skill Jacks: `Read @.brain/2-agent-spock/d-skill-jacks/tdd-vitest.skill-jack.ts`

* `[x] Integration Tests`
    * Location: `packages/[package-name]/testing/integration/`
    * Command to run all tests: `turbo run test:integration`
    * Command to run a single test: `pnpm --filter @kit/[package-name] test:integration -- -t "test name"`
    * Relevant Skill Jacks: `Read @.brain/2-agent-spock/d-skill-jacks/tdd-vitest.skill-jack.ts`

* `[x] End-to-End (E2E) Tests`
    * Location: `packages/[package-name]/testing/e2e/`
    * Command to run all tests: `turbo run test:e2e`
    * Command to run a single test: `pnpm --filter @kit/[package-name] test:e2e -- -t "test name"`
    * Relevant Skill Jacks: `Read @.brain/2-agent-spock/d-skill-jacks/tdd-vitest.skill-jack.ts`

### 5.2. Selected Testing Approach

* We will focus on unit tests for individual functions and methods within each package.
* Integration tests will be used to verify interactions between packages and components.
* E2E tests will be minimal at this stage since we're focusing on foundational packages.
* Testing will follow a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, writing tests before implementing features.
* [x] Confirmed testing approach aligns with project standards.

## 6. MECE Task Breakdown & TDD Plan

### 6.1. Subtask 1: Review and analyze existing packages

* `[x]` Task completed.
* `[x]` Analyze existing package structure to understand patterns and conventions
* `[x]` Identify gaps and missing core packages needed for the rhythm game
* `[x]` Review package dependencies and relationships
* Relevant Skill Jacks: `Read @.brain/2-agent-spock/d-skill-jacks/monorepo-tooling-pnpm-turbo.skill-jack.ts`
* Testing Type: N/A (Analysis task)

#### Analysis Notes:
- Each package follows a consistent structure with:
  - `src/` directory containing source code
  - `src/types/` for TypeScript types and interfaces
  - `src/index.ts` as the main entry point
  - `testing/` directory for tests
  - `package.json` with script definitions and dependencies
  - `tsconfig.json` extending from `@kit/tsconfig/base`
  - `README.md` with usage information and API docs
- There are already 15 packages in the monorepo but we need to create:
  - `core-midi` for Web MIDI device integration
  - `pattern-loader` for rhythm pattern handling
  - `rhythm-engine` for game mechanics like hit detection and scoring
  - `latency-calibration` for input timing adjustments
- Package dependencies follow a unidirectional pattern with lower-level packages (e.g., utils) being used by higher-level ones
- Each package has consistent scripts for testing, linting, and type checking
- All packages use the `@djentronome` namespace
- Existing packages use vitest for unit, integration, and e2e testing
