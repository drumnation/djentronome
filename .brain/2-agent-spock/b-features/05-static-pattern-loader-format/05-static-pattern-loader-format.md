## Feature: Static Pattern Loader & Format

## Task: Implement the Static Pattern Loader & Format

## Status: âœ… Completed

- Technical Details Doc: ../../../../docs/features/static-pattern-loader-format/technical-details.md

## 1. Overview

This task involves finalizing and enhancing the pattern loader and format definition for the Djentronome application. The pattern loader will be responsible for loading, parsing, and validating rhythm patterns from static JSON files. The format definition will establish a standardized structure for rhythm patterns, including metadata, sections, and notes. This feature is essential for providing structured rhythm patterns that can be used by the game loop and scoring system.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Key Files & Modules

* `packages/pattern-loader/src/index.ts`: Main entry point for the pattern loader package, exports the PatternLoader class and types.
* `packages/pattern-loader/src/pattern-loader.ts`: Contains the PatternLoader class implementation with methods for loading and validating patterns.
* `packages/pattern-loader/src/types/index.ts`: Defines the type interfaces for Pattern, PatternSection, Note, and related structures.
* `packages/pattern-loader/src/pattern-loader.unit.test.ts`: Unit tests for the PatternLoader class.
* `packages/utils/src/index.ts`: Shared utilities used by the pattern-loader package.

### 2.2. Dependencies

* `@djentronome/utils`: Internal workspace package for shared utilities.
* `vitest`: Testing framework for running unit and integration tests (v0.34.0).
* `@kit/testing`: Internal workspace package for shared testing utilities.
* `@kit/tsconfig`: Internal workspace package for shared TypeScript configuration.

### 2.3. Potential Concerns

* Pattern loading from network sources may introduce latency or failures during gameplay.
  * [X] Mark as addressed
* The current pattern format may not accommodate all rhythm game scenarios (e.g., complex polyrhythms, tempo changes).
  * [X] Mark as addressed
* Large pattern files may cause performance issues when loading or processing.
  * [X] Mark as addressed

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Selected Paradigm

* Module-based Architecture - A modular approach where the pattern loader is a standalone service that can be imported and used by other modules such as the game loop or scoring system.
* [X] Confirmed with the user

### 3.2. Selected Design Patterns

* Factory Pattern - The PatternLoader acts as a factory for creating and validating Pattern objects.
* [X] Confirmed with the user
* Adapter Pattern - The pattern loader adapts raw JSON data into strongly-typed Pattern objects for use in the game.
* [X] Confirmed with the user

### 3.3. Architectural Considerations & Rationale

* The pattern loader is designed as a separate module to enforce separation of concerns and allow for easy testing and maintenance.
* The pattern format is structured to support both a flat list of notes and hierarchical sections, providing flexibility for different types of patterns.
* Validation is built into the pattern loader to ensure that patterns meet the required format before being used in the game.
* The format supports extensibility through optional fields and metadata, allowing for future enhancements without breaking compatibility.
* The pattern loader is designed to work with both local and remote pattern files, supporting different deployment scenarios.
* [X] Confirmed with the user

## 4. Project Task List Foresight

### 4.1. Downstream Impacts

* F6: Basic Game Loop - Will consume patterns produced by this feature to drive game mechanics.
* F8: Hit Detection & Basic Scoring - Will use note timing information from patterns for scoring calculations.
* F12: Latency Calibration Tool - May need to adjust pattern timing based on calibration results.
* [X] Reviewed and confirmed no negative impacts

### 4.2. Future-Proofing Considerations

* Implement versioning in the pattern format to allow for future format changes without breaking existing patterns.
* Ensure pattern metadata is extensible to accommodate future features (e.g., difficulty modifiers, game modes).
* Design the loader with caching capability to improve performance for frequently used patterns.
* Support both synchronous and asynchronous loading to accommodate different usage scenarios.
* [X] Discussed with the user and incorporated feedback

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1. Available Testing Options

* `[X] Unit Tests`
  * Location: `packages/pattern-loader/src/*.unit.test.ts`
  * Command to run all tests: `pnpm test --filter @djentronome/pattern-loader`
  * Command to run a single test: `pnpm test --filter @djentronome/pattern-loader -- -t "test name"`
  * Relevant Skill Jacks: `Read @.brain/2-agent-spock/d-skill-jacks/tdd-vitest.skill-jack.ts`

* `[X] Integration Tests`
  * Location: `packages/pattern-loader/src/test/*.integration.test.ts`
  * Command to run all tests: `pnpm test:integration --filter @djentronome/pattern-loader`
  * Command to run a single test: `pnpm test:integration --filter @djentronome/pattern-loader -- -t "test name"`
  * Relevant Skill Jacks: `Read @.brain/2-agent-spock/d-skill-jacks/tdd-vitest.skill-jack.ts`

### 5.2. Selected Testing Approach

* We will primarily use unit tests to verify the functionality of the PatternLoader class, including pattern validation, loading, and creation. Integration tests will be used to test the interaction between the pattern loader and the file system or network. This approach ensures that the pattern loader works correctly in isolation and in the context of the broader application.
* [X] Confirmed testing approach aligns with project standards.
