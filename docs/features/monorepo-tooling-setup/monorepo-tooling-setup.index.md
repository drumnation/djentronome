# Feature: Monorepo & Tooling Setup

**Last Updated:** Monday, May 05, 2025 at 07:38:08 PM

This feature establishes a robust TypeScript monorepo architecture for the Djentronome project using pnpm for package management and Turborepo for build orchestration. The setup provides a foundation for efficient development workflows, code sharing between packages, and optimized build processes.

The monorepo is structured with clear separation of concerns across domain-specific packages with standardized configurations for TypeScript, testing, linting, and formatting.
