Agent Behavior:
- Define AI state (e.g., idle, patrol, chase, attack) in components or tags
- Use simple logic or finite-state machines to control transitions
- Read from the world (e.g., distance to player, line of sight) to make decisions
- Emit commands or modify components based on decisions (e.g., move toward target)
