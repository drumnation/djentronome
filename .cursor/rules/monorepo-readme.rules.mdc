# `monorepo-readme.rules.mdc`
_Last Updated: 2025-04-05_

## Purpose

This rule governs the maintenance of the **root `README.md`** in a monorepo using tools like **pnpm workspaces** and **Turborepo**. It ensures the README accurately reflects:

- The structure and purpose of each workspace package (`apps/`, `packages/`, etc.)
- Core commands, tooling, and workspace setup
- Developer instructions for running, building, and testing across packages

## Rule Scope

This rule replaces `root-readme.rules.mdc` in all monorepos.

> ‚úÖ Apply this rule **only** when monorepo structure is detected (multiple workspaces, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `turbo.json`).

---

## Trigger: When to Update the Root README

You MUST trigger a README review and potential update after any task involving:

1. **New Package or App Added**  
   ‚Üí e.g., new workspace under `apps/` or `packages/`

2. **Turborepo or Workspace Changes**  
   ‚Üí e.g., changes to `turbo.json`, shared scripts, or affected pipelines

3. **Updated Dev Commands**  
   ‚Üí e.g., new or changed `build`, `dev`, `lint`, `test`, `format`, or `deploy` commands across packages

4. **Monorepo Dependency or Install Flow Updates**  
   ‚Üí e.g., added global tooling, new `.env` files, installation scripts, etc.

5. **Core Architecture or Cross-Package Refactor**  
   ‚Üí e.g., major restructuring of package responsibilities, moved shared utilities, introduced new orchestrators

6. **Package Deprecation or Removal**  
   ‚Üí e.g., removed unused internal packages, sunset a legacy app

## Agent Behavior: README Update Workflow

If a major change triggers this rule:

1. ‚úÖ **Log Impact:** Internally note that `README.md` may need updates  
2. üì• **Read Existing README:** Load and parse root `README.md`  
3. üß† **Analyze Affected Sections:** Determine what needs to change based on the type of update. Key sections:
   - Monorepo Overview / Architecture
   - Package Directory Table (apps/packages)
   - Getting Started (installation, setup)
   - Common Dev Commands (via `turbo`, `pnpm`, etc.)
   - Shared Config (e.g., Prettier, ESLint, Vitest)
   - CI/CD Setup (optional)
4. ‚úçÔ∏è **Draft Update:** Generate concise, helpful edits to reflect the change
5. üíæ **Apply Changes:** Update `README.md` directly  
6. üìò **Log Completion:** Confirm update and include it in the next commit

---

## Style & Content Guidelines

- Keep the **first screen** of the README clean and inviting
- Include a clear **table of workspaces** or `apps/` and `packages/` with short descriptions
- Include setup instructions:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  pnpm dev
  ```

- Mention usage of:
  - `turbo run <task>` for parallel workflows
  - Shared tooling or configs: `eslint`, `prettier`, `vitest`, `storybook`, etc.
