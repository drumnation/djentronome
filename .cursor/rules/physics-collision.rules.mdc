Agent Behavior:
- Use bounding boxes or simple shapes (circle, rect) for collision checks
- Detect overlap between entities with `position` and `size` components
- Emit collision events or tags (e.g., `isHit`, `shouldDestroy`)
- Optionally resolve collisions (e.g., prevent movement, reduce health)
- Layer collision types (e.g., player, terrain, triggers)
- Separate collision detection from resolution
