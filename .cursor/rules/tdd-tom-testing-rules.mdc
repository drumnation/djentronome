## New Feature TDD Rule

**Description:**

**Mandatory Rule: All new features MUST be implemented using Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.**  Prioritize tests before code, ensuring comprehensive coverage and a robust design. Tests should be focused and efficient, employing either unit or integration tests as appropriate. All tests MUST adhere to the **Test Object Model** for improved maintainability and reusability where it makes sense.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Choose the Right Testing Strategy:**
    *   **BEFORE writing any tests, deeply consider whether a UNIT test or an INTEGRATION test is most effective for the feature or component being developed.**
    *   **UNIT Tests:** Focus on individual modules or functions in isolation, mocking dependencies. Ideal for testing complex logic within a single unit.
        *   **Consider using unit tests when:**
            *   The logic within a single function or class is complex and needs thorough testing.
            *   Dependencies can be easily and realistically mocked.
            *   You need to isolate a specific unit to verify its behavior in detail.
        *   **For guidance on writing unit tests, refer to the Unit Test Writing Guide:** READ `@.brain/knowledge/testing/vitest/vitest-unit-testing.rules.ts`
    *   **INTEGRATION Tests:** Test the interaction between multiple modules or systems. They verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.
        *   **Consider using integration tests when:**
            *   The functionality depends on the interaction between multiple components, services, or external systems (e.g., databases, APIs, CLIs).
            *   Mocking is difficult, unrealistic, or overly complex.
            *   You need to ensure that different parts of the system work together correctly in a realistic environment.
        *   **For guidance on writing integration tests, refer to the Integration Test Writing Guide:** READ `@.brain/knowledge/testing/vitest/vitest-integration-testing.rules.ts`
    *   **Document the reasoning behind your choice of unit or integration testing in the code or test file.**

2.  **Start with tests:** Before writing any implementation code, create a failing test case that defines the desired behavior of the new feature, based on the chosen testing strategy.

3.  **Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle:**
    *   **Red:** Write a failing test (unit or integration).
    *   **Green:** Write the minimal code to make the test pass.
    *   **Refactor:** Improve code structure while keeping the test green. Be cautious about over-abstracting or introducing unnecessary complexity during refactoring. If tests get more complicated because of the refactoring, it is a code smell.
    *   **Repeat:** Move to the next part of the feature

4.  **Employ the Test Object Model (When Appropriate):**
    *   **If the Test Object Model is deemed beneficial for organization and reusability (e.g., in complex integration tests or UI tests),** create a `*.to.ts` file for each logical group of interactions or components being tested.
    *   Encapsulate interaction logic within this test object.
    *   Example:

        ```typescript
        // user-registration.to.ts
        import { UserService } from './user-service';

        export class UserRegistrationTestObject {
            private userService: UserService;

            constructor() {
                this.userService = new UserService();
            }

            async registerUser(userData: any) {
                return await this.userService.register(userData);
            }
        }
        ```
    *  **Do not force the use of the Test Object Model if it adds unnecessary complexity or doesn't provide significant value in simpler scenarios.**

5.  **Consult the detailed guidelines for comprehensive instructions:**
    *   **TDD:** READ `@.brain/knowledge/testing/vitest/vitest-tdd.rules.ts`
    *   **Test Object Model:** READ `@.brain/knowledge/testing/vitest/vitest-test-object-model.rules.ts`
    *   **Unit vs. Integration Testing:** READ `@.brain/knowledge/testing/unit-vs-integration-testing.rules.ts`

**Enforcement:** Strict (This rule must be followed without exception. The reasoning behind choosing a specific testing strategy should always be clearly documented.)

# Rule: Functional Test Principles

Purpose:
Ensure all test suites — regardless of test framework — validate real, end-to-end or integration-level functionality. Tests must act as a backstop for the app. If they pass, the app works. If they fail, something meaningful is broken. This allows the agent to self-validate and iterate safely.

Frameworks: Mocha, Vitest, Jest, Playwright, Cypress, Storybook, etc.  
The principles apply across all test environments.

Agent Behavior:

1. **Test Real Use, Not Implementation**
   - Simulate real usage, not internals
   - Validate user-visible outputs or API responses
   - Never test internal method calls, hook behavior, or prop structures directly

2. **Avoid Mocking**
   - Mock only:
     - External APIs (e.g., HTTP requests)
     - Uncontrollable globals (e.g., time, environment)
   - Never mock internal app logic or structure just to make a test work
   - Avoid testing `.mock.calls` or `spyOn()` unless testing infrastructure-level effects

3. **One-to-One Principle**
   - If the test passes → the feature works
   - If the test fails → the feature is broken, misaligned, or needs to be updated with intention

4. **Tests Should Be Lightweight and Runnable Often**
   - Run them after every meaningful code change
   - Favor a small number of high-signal tests over hundreds of shallow coverage tests

5. **Use for Self-Validation**
   - The agent should use tests as the basis for confirming its changes are correct
   - No agent-generated code should be considered complete until the relevant tests pass

6. **Do Not Over-Isolate**
   - Avoid deep mocking that isolates a function from its context
   - Prefer integration and functional tests for most features
   - Unit tests should be used only for pure functions or small reusable utilities

7. **Include Test Planning in Feature Design**
   - When writing a plan for any task or feature, include:
     - What needs to be tested
     - How it can be tested without mocks
     - What defines success/failure

8. **Failure ≠ Delete**
   - If a test fails, investigate
   - Fix the code if it’s a regression
   - Update the test only after understanding the cause
   - Never delete or bypass a test just to make the suite green

# Rule: Detect Active Test Framework

Trigger: When a test plan or test execution step is needed

Behavior:
- Look for known files:
  - `vitest.config.ts`
  - `.mocharc.js`
  - `jest.config.js`
  - `playwright.config.ts`
- Or scan `package.json` for:
  - Installed devDependencies
- Or prompt the user: “What test framework should I use here?”
